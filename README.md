# Python-Socket
A python program that uses sockets to interact between a server and a client.

A <strong>socket</socket> is one endpoint of a two-way communication channel between two networked programs.Â 

By creating named contact points between which the communication takes place, the socket mechanism offers a form of inter-process communication (IPC).
